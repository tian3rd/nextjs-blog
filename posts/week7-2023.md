## Monday

My current place is a bit far from the company, and I know for a fact that a major part of the road is suceptible to traffic jams. So I got up early (also because didn't sleep well) and used Google Maps to navigate. Unfortunately, I was a bit too early, so I went back to my car and read for a little while.

Set up the system in the new laptop, and had lunch with the two other graduates P and B, and the graduates from the last batch of the recruitment.

Too many Windows softwares to be stuck with, and there's no way out it seems. Never mind...

Dan walked with me and we chatted a little. He's a really frank humorous but modest guy. Pleasant to chat with, and I feel it's the single most important trait of a good leader. From my first two supervisors Bram and Sheon, to my last supervisor Graham, and now Dan, they all lead by example and enjoy the challenge.

Spent the rest of the day setting up my profile photos, sadly. And got started in learning `docker`.

### Team

- Better ask than assume
- Find your motivation
- Build little by little

### Technical

Didn't expect to be joining the DevOps team, and there's surely a lot to catch up with. For example, `docker` and `ci/cd`.

### Setup

Got a new Dell laptop with 64GB RAM, should be enough for most of the work.

Two 24 inch monitors, sadly they're both 1080p.
